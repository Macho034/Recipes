<h3> Loaded Baked Potato</h3>
    <img src="Loaded_Baked_Potato.jpg" alt="Loaded Baked Potato">
    <h2>Directions </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Arrange 2 shelves to divide the oven into thirds, then heat the oven to 400ºF. Meanwhile, wash and scrub 4 large russet potatoes. Prick each potato all over with a fork. Rub the potatoes all over with 1 tablespoon olive oil, then sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon of the kosher salt. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil, then place 6 slices bacon in a single layer on the foil.</li>
            <li>Place the bacon on the upper rack and the potatoes directly on the lower rack. Bake until the bacon is crisp and golden-brown, 15 to 20 minutes, and the potatoes have crisp skin and are fork-tender, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>When the bacon is ready, immediately transfer to a clean cutting board. Cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-wide pieces.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, shred 8 ounces cheddar cheese on the large holes of a box grater (about 2 cups). Cut 5 tablespoons unsalted butter into a few pieces and place in a large bowl. Thinly slice 3 medium scallions, keeping the whites and dark green parts separate. Finely chop 1 bunch fresh chives until you have 4 tablespoons. Transfer the scallion whites and 3 tablespoons of the chives to the bowl of butter. Reserve the scallion greens and remaining 1 tablespoon chives for garnish.</li>
            <li>When potatoes are ready, set aside for 5 minutes to cool slightly. Discard the foil from the baking sheet, then line the baking sheet with parchment paper. Cut a slit lengthwise most of the way down each potato, making sure the halves are still connected. Carefully scoop out the potato flesh and place in the bowl of butter, leaving about 1/4-inch potato flesh as the shell. Place the potato shells skin-side down on the baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Coarsely mash the potato-butter mixture directly in the bowl with a potato masher or fork until the butter is melted. Add half of the bacon, 1 cup of the cheese, 6 tablespoons of the sour cream, 1/4 cup milk, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, the remaining 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon white or black pepper. Mix thoroughly with rubber spatula until combined.</li>
            <li>Divide the mixture between the potato shells, mounding the mixture. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup cheese. Bake on the upper rack until the cheese is melted, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with the remaining bacon and reserved scallion greens. Dollop with the remaining 6 tablespoons sour cream and sprinkle with the reserved chives.</li>
